## `grep`

I chose to research on the command `grep`, where I will explore the following command-line arguments:
- `-n`
- `-v`
- `-r`
- `-i`

I researched on each command from the GNU manual page, https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html#Command_002dline-Options. 

## `-r`

`grep -r` is a command line argument that uses recursion while searching through repositories. This command line is not required to be run on a specific file, but instead has the ability to search every file within a directory, as well as the directory itself.
